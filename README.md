# Pie  
### Description  
The project loops through an array featuring objects containing the instructors' favorite pies. On page load, all pies are printed to the page. When various instructor name buttons are pressed, corresponding smaller arrays of that instructor's favorite pies are formed and printed to the page, replacing the former display. Pressing the 'all' button restores the page to its original view.  
### Screenshots
